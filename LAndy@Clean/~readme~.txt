^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clean Trojan made by LAndy

About: 
======
This trojan does not overwrites or destroys the system, it only makes the
computer to be unusable for amateurs.

Payloads after authorization:
=============================
1. Creating random shortcuts on desktop linking to a HTML file
2. Mirroring the screen + glitches
3. Searches on Google + Bigger glitches
4. HTML file pops up and says: "Your Computer has been fucked"
5. Mirror Screen + more screen glitches + "falling" screen effect
6. Invert screen colors
7. Restarts Windows
8. Copy itself to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
9. After reboot, the trojan runs again
and for amateurs... it is endless...

I am not responsible for any problems

Enjoy :]
